### Project Name
# Neighborood

### Project Description
My neighbours is a site where you will find all the guys around you!
Neighbours are an integral part of our lives.
They are the ones who live close
to us and are often the first point of contact.
We share our happiness and sorrows with our neighbours.
My neighbourâ€™s name is Mr Shyam Shukla.
He is a doctor by profession.
Living in this beautiful community,
we can be blind to the needs of students who feel invisible
or embarrassed because they cannot engage
in what so many of their classmates take for granted.
Our students need to know they are valued and supported.
